Problem that we want to tackle:

Real World events cannot be imported to blockchain easily:

-Requires centralised trust(a single website or some information provider)

-Information might be ambiguous or not contain all that is needed

-Off-chain information cannot be verified within the chain and become completely trustless


Solution needs to:

-Be accessible quickly and easily

-Provide unquestionable and unchangeable information about the real world

-Robust against takeover of one group of people or their influence(Includes robustness against higher order origin convergence, i.e.: all the independent sources must not obtain their information through a single source like google)

-Operate completely trustless like the blockchain itself

-Give accurate/correct information
